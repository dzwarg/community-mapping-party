# Community Mapping Party!

These are some resources for organizing your community's mapping party.

## Background

## What is a Mapping Party?

A [Mapping Party](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties) is a community organized event where people get together to share knowledge about their community, and collaborate on creating and publishing that knowledge to other members of their community.

## What is OpenStreetMap?

[OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world.

## Why use OpenStreetMap?

When you or members of your community add your data to OpenStreetMap, it becomes "open data", published by OpenStreetMap licensed under the [Open Data Commons Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) (ODbL) by the [OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/) (OSMF).

You are free to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt our data, as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon our data, you may distribute the result only under the same licence.

# Step 1

Figure out what your community needs. Define the features that you want to add to the map, and how you will capture information about the features (name, direction, size, etc.)
